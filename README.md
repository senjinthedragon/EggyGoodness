My very first attempt at modding minecraft. Just a smelting recipe for turning eggs into edible baked eggs.

The original files for this mod never made it onto github and I wanted to add them as well as rewrite them a tiny little
bit to be more compliant with the forge framework standards. Although I know how to program in quite a few languages, I
never coded in java before. It's a learning experience for me.
