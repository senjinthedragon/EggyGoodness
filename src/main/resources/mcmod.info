  "description": "A long long time ago, when Minecraftia only just began its existence. There were chickens. And these chickens layed eggs. But try as you might, nobody has ever been able to eat them and get to that creamy yellow yolky goodness.\n\nThose agonizing days are forever gone!\n\nUsing our new advanced chicken modification techniques, we've been able to genetically modify all chickens to lay edible eggs!\n\nThese eggs can be fried, soft- and hard-boiled and even scrambled when cracked in a bowl. They can also be used to cook with. They work fine in cakes and pies and you can make egg sandwiches and even eggnog with some milk and sugar.\n\nEggs can be encrusted in gold and gems to make Faberg√© eggs. And although they look nice decoratively, they can be thrown just like your regular eggs. Maybe a golden chicken will hatch!\n\nYou can peel or break eggshells from the various kinds of eggs by left clicking them on a block. The shells make good fertilizer and golden eggs can make you filthy rich!\n\nEnjoy!",
