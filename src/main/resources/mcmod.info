  "description": "A long long time ago, when Minecraftia only just began it's existance. There were chickens. And these chickens lay eggs. But try as you might, nobody has ever been able to eat them and get to that creamy yellow yolky goodness.\n\nThose agonizing days are forever gone!\n\nUsing our new advanced chicken modifying techniques, we've been able to genetically modify all chickens to lay edible eggs! These eggs can be fried, soft- and hard-boiled and even scrambled.\n\nEnjoy!",
