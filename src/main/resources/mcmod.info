  "description": "A long long time ago, when Minecraftia only just began it's existance. There were chickens. And these chickens lay eggs. But try as you might, nobody has ever been able to eat them and get to that creamy yellow yolky goodness.\n\nThose agonizing days are forever gone!\n\nUsing our new advanced chicken modifying techniques, we've been able to genetically modify all chickens to lay edible eggs! These eggs can be baked. That's right! Just pick up the egg and stick it in a furnace. And all that delicious eggy yummyness will be yours.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n(I know this mod is kinda laughable. But hey, it's my first attempt at modding Minecraft and I needed something simple to get a feel for how it's done.)",
